Our game is called battle fish, it's basically the same game as battle cats, but the difference is instead of cats vs dogs, it's fish battle humans instead. The user buys fish to protect their base from the humans and also to destroy the human base. Inorder to win you just deplete the human base health points before they deplete yours. So far we have 4 levels for you to play, each increasing in difficulty. All you need to run this game is to have python, pygame, and my code.
